## 5.1.1

This minor upgrade includes improvments to tooling, updates to default node configurations.

Validators should recreated `validator.node.yaml` so the network has uniform configurations.

### TL;DR Deployment

```
cd ~/libra
git fetch
git checkout v5.1.1 -f
make bins install web-files

# recreate validator.node.yaml, to have uniform configurations
ol init --val

# you can now restart your services


```
