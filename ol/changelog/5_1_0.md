## 5.1.0

This is a substantial upgrade which had to be issued for the April 2022 network halt.

It mostly contains changes to Move code, and recovery tools.

- Many changes to writeset-transaction-generator to be able to produces writesets for updating stdlib, changing the validator set, entering Recovery Mode, and applying migrations.
- Changes to the Stdlib so that EpochBoundary is more resilient to failures of inactive validators.
- Changes the proof-of-burn, making the cost to enter validator set dynamic.
- Refactor validator qualification to include a minimum vouches of validators in previous validator set.
- Migrations to correct bugs in Autopay, add account Ancestry info, Makewhole payments for underpayment of Carpe.

### TL;DR Deployment

The Stdlib (Move changes), were already issued on a halted network.

There are minimal bugfixes to Tower, added transaction types to Txs, and new data presented in web-monitor.

Validators should update with:

```
cd ~/libra
git fetch
git checkout v5.1.0 -f
make bins install web-files

# you can now restart your services
```
