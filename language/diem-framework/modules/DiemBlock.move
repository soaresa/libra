/// This module defines a struct storing the metadata of the block and new block events.
/// it also contains all of the block prologue logic which is called from the Rust executor.

/// For 0L the following changes are applied to the block prologue

// Autopay gets processed when the Autopay Tick occurs. This occurs on round X (TODO)

// Round 2
// On the Rust side, every round 2, is an Upgrade Tick. That's when the VM checks if there are upgrade proposals that have reached consensus, and if so and there is an upgrade payload available (binary) then a writeset of that binary is executed and the 0x1 address is overwritten with the upgrade binary.

// Round 3
// In Move, we check if we are in a Migrate Tick, which is every round 3. (TODO: should this be 2?). That's when any data and state migrations that can happen on the fly will occur.

// Epoch Boundary
// In the prologue we finally check for a roughtime 24h period to have passed, and that is what triggers an epoch boundary, and the necessary reconfiguration and account updates.
